Hosts: 
Me, Bank, Mamiew, and Kan. 

Food is important! It is probably one of the most important aspect of life just second to water. Our ancestors spend heaps of time and effort to obtain food. These days, food (for most of us, at least in middle-income to rich countries) are easy to come by. But with the ubiquity comes issues like over-eating, obesity, malnutrition (not getting adequate 'good' nutrition), and food waste. 

In this week's episode p'Mamiew talks about ways to prevent over-eating while p'Kan discusses the issue of food waste and ways we can all waste less. 

Later in the episode, I share some fun statistics about Thai restaurants in Australia. Bank wraps up the show talking about the relationship between food and ASMR (Autonomous sensory meridian response). Finally, Bank shares the etymology of the word "Massaman" (curry) and the Thai word for cilantro/coriander.
