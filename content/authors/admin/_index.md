I like learning about how life form come to be the way they are and how we can appropriately care for them today and into the future.  I enjoy the challenge of working in aspects of biology that are overlooked (could be said about every aspect I suppose), making scientific knowledge understandable for people around the world and bringing people together to do something useful. 

Currently, I am a PhD student in the Keogh Lab at the Australian National University (ANU). My thesis focuses on the evolutionary relationships among Australian blind snakes (genus Anilios). Before starting at the ANU I completed my M.S. in Biological Sciences at Auburn University under the advisory of Dr. Dan Warner (Warner Laboratory).

Beyond research, I am keen on photography, scuba diving, football (soccer), and seeing as much of the world as possible. I enjoy spending time in nature and immersing myself into different cultures to appreciate the (bio)diversity of life. I also ocassionally host a Thai radio program on CMS Radio.
